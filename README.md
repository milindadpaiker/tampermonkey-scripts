# tampermonkey-scripts
These are a bunch of tamper monkey scripts I use to transform web experience.
1. neetcode-revist-local.js:
tag/untag problems on https://neetcode.io/problems/* as revisit. List of revisit tagged problems can be viewed by clicking on Show revisit list button. Saves the problems on localstorage in your browser.

2. neetcode-revisit-tmstorage.js
tag/untag problems on https://neetcode.io/problems/* as revisit. List of revisit tagged problems can be viewed by clicking on Show revisit list button. Saves the tagged problems in tampermonkey's internal storage. Hence survives site data cleanup/cache clear in the browsers.
